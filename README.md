# Expense Tracker Fullstack Project

## Overview

The Expense Tracker is a fullstack web application designed to help users manage their finances by tracking incomes and expenses effectively. Built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, this project integrates a MongoDB database for data persistence.


In today's fast-paced world, individuals often struggle to keep track of their financial health. Many existing applications lack user-friendly interfaces or comprehensive features for managing both income and expenses in one place. This motivated the development of a fullstack expense tracker application.

The goal was to create an easy-to-use web application that allows users to:
- Add, view, and delete their income and expense records.
- Ensure data persistence through a reliable backend service.
- Provide a clean and intuitive user interface for enhanced user experience.

   - Implemented styled-components for modular and maintainable styling.

2. **Backend Development**:

   - Designed RESTful API endpoints for managing income and expense records.
   - Connected to a MongoDB database using Mongoose to store and retrieve financial data.

3. **User Authentication** (optional, if applicable):
   - Integrated user authentication to provide personalized experiences.

4. **Testing**:
   - Conducted testing for both frontend and backend components to ensure functionality and reliability.

The completed Expense Tracker application provides users with:
- A seamless experience to track their financial health through a responsive and interactive interface.
